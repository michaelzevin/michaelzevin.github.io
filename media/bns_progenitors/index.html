The following animation shows the kinematic evolution of a simulated double neutron star system that may have been the progenitor of GW170817.
Using the observed offset of GW170817 from its host galaxy (NGC 4993), we can constrain aspects of the stellar evolutionary process that led to its formation.
The pair of stars—a neutron star and a normal star—orbit quietly, until the normal star undergoes a supernova, spawning a second neutron star and “kicking” the system into an elliptical orbit.
The two neutron stars eventually merge and generate gravitational waves, a gamma-ray burst, and an explosion called a kilonova. Other potential lives are shown in the thinner, lighter-colored lines.
Data for this animation comes from the analysis in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...850L..40A/abstract">Abbott et al. 2017 (ApJ 850L, 40A)</a>.
