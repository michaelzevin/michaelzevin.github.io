title: Binary Black Hole Media

<div class="row">

<p>
The following simulations show binary-binary encounters involving four black holes, which occur at the cores of dense stellar systems such as gloublar clusters. 
Such encounters can lead to long-lived "resonating" interactions, through which many temporary binary systems are created. 
When one correctly includes post-Newtonian terms in the equations of motion, the formation of a highly eccentric binary can lead to a rapid inspiral and merge due to gravitational wave emission zapping orbital energy. 
These mergers can maintain their high eccentricies into the LIGO sensitive frequency range and occur at a rate accessible by advanced LIGO. 
If detected, such systems will highly constrain their formation scenario and be a clear indicator that dynamics can play a key role in facillitating binary black hole mergers. 
Examples below are from Zevin et al. 2018.
