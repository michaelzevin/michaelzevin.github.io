<p>
The following visualizations show simulations of binary-binary encounters involving four black holes, which occur at the cores of dense stellar systems such as gloublar clusters. 
Such encounters can lead to long-lived "resonating" interactions, through which many temporary binary systems are created. 
With the inclusion of post-Newtonian terms in the equations of motion, when a highly eccentric binary forms it can rapidly inspiral and merge due to orbital energy being zapped through gravitational wave emission. 
These mergers can maintain their high eccentricies into the LIGO sensitive frequency range, and if detected will highly constrain their formation scenario. 
Examples below are from Zevin et al. 2018.
