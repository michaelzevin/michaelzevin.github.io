I'm very excited to announce that I've started a new position as an astronomer at the Adler Planetarium.
In this role, I'll be continuing my personal research on gravitational waves, and will maintain my collaborations with Northwestern University and The University of Chicago with visiting scholar appointments.

One of the things I'm most excited about in this new role are the informal education and outreach initiatives that I will be a part of.
In addition to the amazing science outreach that is already underway at the planetarium, such as citizen science with Zooniverse, light pollution research with the Far Horizons ballooning project, and public observing with the Doane Observatory, I'm looking forward to spearheading the restart and reimagination of the Astronomy Conversation series.

More to come --- excited to begin this new chapter!
