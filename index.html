Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in astrophysics at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. 
My research revolves around ways we can investigate the lives and deaths of stars using observations of gravitational waves -- ripples in the fabric of spacetime that emanate from extreme systems in the universe such as colliding compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. 
I am part of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which made the first observation of gravitational waves in September 2015. 
I am also heaviliy involved in science education and public outreach, and getting members of the general public interested and engaged in scientific advancements through participation citizen science. Outside of astronomy, I can be found playing music around the Windy City, looking up, and getting lost in the infinite corners of the globe.
