I recently was a speaker at a TEDx workshop at Northern Illinois University! The theme of the workshop was "The Puzzle of Purpose: Finding Meaning in Life's Pieces." I chose to talk about how life and humans are intimiately connected to a wide range of cosmic events that transpired over billions of years --- our cosmic origin story and how the universe synthesized our most fundamental building blocks.
