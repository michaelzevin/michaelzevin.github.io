		I spend a fair bit of time and energy trying to talk to as many people as I can about astronomy (most research in the field is taxpayer-funded after all, so it’s the least I can do to give back). Here’s a few fun things I’ve been involved in over the years:<br />
	</p>
	<h2 style="-webkit-margin-before: 1.5em;">Dearborn Observatory</h2>
	<p align="justify">
		One of the oldest, largest refracting telescopes around, Dearborn Observatory is a sight to behold. Every Friday night, the observatory is opened up for <a href="http://www.physics.northwestern.edu/about/dearborn-observatory/">public viewing</a>, where a few undergrad or grad students will guide guests through viewing different astronomical objects with the telescope (weather permitting, of course).<br />
		<br />
		In addition to the usual Friday night observing, I also occasionally help out with the monthly <a href="http://ciera.northwestern.edu/AstroEvenings/">Astronomer Evenings</a> event series, in which a few astro folks give short presentations and do QA sessions while the public observing is going on.<br />
	</p>
	<h2 style="-webkit-margin-before: 1.5em;">Astronomy on Tap</h2>
	<p align="justify">
		<a href="https://astronomyontap.org/">Astronomy on Tap</a> is a worldwide series of informal presentations on astronomy, given at local bars/breweries. Along with several other grad students and postdocs, I helped start the local Chicago chapter (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/aotchicago">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AoTchicago">Twitter</a>). We've been fortunate to partner with some pretty great Chicago area breweries - <a href="http://www.smyliebros.com/">Smylie Bros Brewing</a>, <a href="http://www.halfacrebeer.com">Half Acre Beer Company</a>, and <a href="http://begylebrewing.com">Begyle Brewing</a> so far. Our events usually feature a few quick, fun talks about various things in astronomy (research, current exciting news, interactive demos), as well as some space-themed trivia rounds. Mostly, we're there to chat and drink beer, though.
