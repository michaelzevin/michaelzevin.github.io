	<p align="justify">
		<a href="https://astrobites.org/">Astrobites</a> is a daily astrophysical literature journal written and run by graduate students in astronomy. 
Since its inception in 2010, Astrobites has published over 2000 and the site reveives about half a million visits a year. 
I spent two years as a regular author on Astrobites (you can read my posts <a href="https://astrobites.org/author/mzevin/">here</a>) and now serve on the leadership team for Astrobites. 
One of the things I was most proud of helping to develop were the <a href="https://astrobites.org/#beyond">Beyond astro-ph</a> series of posts, which are written instead of the standard astro-ph summary once every couple weeks and cover topics ranging from career advice to classic astrophysical papers to the state of diversity and inclusivity in astronomy. 
Astrobites is now partnered with the <a href="https://aas.org/">American Astronomical Societyi</a>.

        Astronomy on Tap
		<a href="https://astronomyontap.org/">Astronomy on Tap</a> is a worldwide series of informal presentations on astronomy, hosted at local bars and breweries. 
Along with several other graduate students and postdocs at Northwestern, I helped start the local Chicago chapter (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/aotchicago">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AoTchicago">Twitter</a>). 
We've been lucky enough to partner with some great breweries all around the Windy City, such as <a href="http://begylebrewing.com">Begyle Brewing Company</a>, <a href="https://www.empiricalbrewery.com/">Empirical Brewery</a>, <a href="https://www.halfacrebeer.com/">Half Acre Beer Company</a>, <a href="http://metrobrewing.com/">Metropolitan Brewery</a>, and <a href="http://www.smyliebros.com/">Smylie Bros Brewing</a> so far.
We also are partnered with the Adler Planetarium, and host live astronomy trivia at their monthly 21+ <a href="https://www.adlerplanetarium.org/adler-after-dark/">Adler After Dark</a> event.

	<h2 style="-webkit-margin-before: 1.5em;">Astronomer Conversations at the Adler Planetarium</h2>
	<p align="justify">
		Once a month, I present at the Adler Planetarium's Space Visualization Laboratory (SVL). 
The SVL provides a platform for the general public to ask experts about the latest space news and hear about the cutting edge astrophysical research taking place in Chicago. 
The beautiful visualizations which accompany the talks make if truly an immersive experience, both for the audience and the speaker.

	<h2 style="-webkit-margin-before: 1.5em;">ComSciCon</h2>
	<p align="justify">
		<a href="https://comscicon.com/">ComSciCon</a> is a series of workshops focused on the communication of complex and technical concepts organized by graduate students, for graduate students. 
ComSciCon attendees meet and interact with professional communicators, build lasting networks with graduate students in all fields of science and engineering from around the country, and write and publish original works.
After attending the national ComSciCon workshop in 2017, I become a part of the Program Organizing Commitee for the national workshops.

	<h2 style="-webkit-margin-before: 1.5em;">CIERA Astronomer Evenings at the Dearborn Observatory</h2>
	<p align="justify">
		As part the agreement for acquiring the telescope, Northwestern University has has opened up the <a href="https://www.physics.northwestern.edu/about/dearborn-observatory/">Dearborn Observatory</a> to the public on a weekly basis for observing. 
Once a month, we accompany the public observing with talks by CIERA astronomers about various topics in astronomy. 
Besides helping to host the public observing sessions, I present at these monthly topics on various astronomical topics.
