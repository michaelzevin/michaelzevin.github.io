        Throughout the history of astronomy, humanity has been reliant on one form of information to build our knowledge about the cosmos - light. 
However, in the past few years, astronomers have unlocked a new messenger from the cosmos, a new sense with which to explore the universe. 
This new messenger, known as gravitational waves (GWs), are minuscule ripples in the fabric of spacetime that encode information about objects with extreme gravity in the universe, such as black holes. 
Since the first observation of GWs from two coalescing black holes by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) in September 2015, GWs have taken the astronomical community by storm.

My research focuses on using GWs to explore the lives and deaths of stars, and learn more about the extreme objects that stars become. 
LIGO excels at detecting GWs that emanate from the final inspiral and merger of compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. 
One outstanding question that I hope to answer is "Where do the black holes that LIGO detects come from?" 
There are multiple pathways that astronomer believe may lead to merging black holes, such as through the evolution of two massive stars in isolation or through dynamical encounters of black holes in dense stellar systems such as globular clusters. 
These pathways predict different properties for the merging black holes, such as masses, spins, and orbital eccentricities, which may be encrypted in the GW signals we detect. 
I work to build statistical models which use the growing number of GW detections to unveil the relative rate that different formation channels produce binary black holes, as well as help to constrain uncertain physical aspects of stellar evolution. 
I also model black hole interactions in globular clusters to identify unique properties of black hole mergers in the GW signal that would indicate a dynamical formation channel rather than one where the black holes formed in isolation.

LIGO can also detect the merger of the dense remnant cores of massive stars, known as neutron stars. 
The first detection of merging neutron stars was found by LIGO in August 2017, and accompanied by a rainbow of light across the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the subsequent kilonova explosion and gamma-ray burst. 
This discovery was the first to combine gravitational waves and light to build a better understanding of an astronphysical event - the "holy grail" of multi-messenger astronomy. 
I also study how we can use such detections to extrapolate backwards in time and learn about the stellar system that formed the neutron stars. 
In particular, I model the evolution of how such systems move following the supernova explosion that formed the neutron stars, which "kicks" the system and alters its trajectory through their galaxy. 
Using both neutron star mergers observed by LIGO and observations of short gamma-ray bursts, we aim to constrains aspects of the progenitor systems prior to the supernova explosion, and learn about the kicks that the supernovae imparted on the systems.

One other area of research I am involved in is "citizen science" - involving the general public scientific data analysis through crowdsouring. 
I helped to build the first GW project on the Zooniverse citizen science platform: <a href="https://www.gravityspy.org" target="_blank">Gravity Spy</a>.
Being the most sensitive gravtitaional experiment ever built, the LIGO detectors are susceptible to sources of environmental and instrumental noise, known as "glitches", which afflict our sensitivity to the GW universe and cna even masquerade as astrophysical signals. 
A comprehensive characterization of such noise signals is paramount to LIGO achieving its sensitivity goals. 
However, as hundreds of thousands of glitches occur in the detectors during an observing run, this task would overwhelm any small group of scientists. 
The Gravity Spy project combines the power of machine learning algorithms withs volunteers from the general public to look at LIGO data containing glitches, and better understand where such sources of noise come from. 
Creating a symbiotic relationship between volunteer classifications and machine learning will help to scale citizen science with the ever-increasing datasets of the future.
