        Throughout the history of astronomy, humanity has been reliant on one form of information to build our knowledge about the cosmos - light. 
However, in the past few years, astronomers have unlocked a new messenger from the cosmos, a new sense with which to explore the universe. 
This new messenger, known as gravitational waves, are minuscule ripples in the fabric of spacetime that encode information about objects with extreme gravity in the universe, such as black holes. 
Since the first observation of gravitational waves from two coalescing black holes by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) in September 2015, gravitational waves have taken the astronomical community by storm. 

My research focuses on using gravitational waves to unveil the lives and deaths of stars, and learn more about the extreme objects that stars become. 
LIGO excels at detecting gravitational waves that emanate from the final inspiral and merger of compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars. 
One outstanding question that I hope to answer is "Where do the black holes that LIGO detects come from?" 
There are multiple pathways that astronomer believe may lead to merging black holes, such as through the evolution of two massive stars in isolation or through dynamical encounters of black holes in dense stellar systems such as globular clusters. 
These pathways predict different properties for the merging black holes, such as masses, spins, and orbital eccentricities, which may be encrypted in the gravitational wave signals we detect. 
I work to build statistical models for using the growing number of gravitational wave detections to learn a
