        Throughout the history of astronomy, humanity has been reliant on one form of information to build our knowledge about the cosmos - light. 
However, in the past few years, astronomers have unlocked a new messenger from the cosmos, a new sense with which to explore the universe. 
This new messenger, known as gravitational waves, are minuscule ripples in the fabric of spacetime that encode information about objects with extreme gravity in the universe, such as black holes. 
Since the first observation of gravitational waves from two coalescing black hoels in September 2015, gravitational waves have taken the astronomical community by storm. 

My research focuses on using gravitational waves to unveil the lives and deaths of stars, and learn more about the extreme objects that stars become.
